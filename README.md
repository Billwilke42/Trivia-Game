# Chalkboard Trivia

## Abstract

This is the group project from The Turing School of Software & Design's Mod 3 of Front-End Engineering. The assigned objectives were to use an external API and a technology we would teach ourselves to build an application of our own design. We chose to use the [Open Trivia DB](https://opentdb.com/api_config.php) API and Redux to build a trivia game loosely based on schoolhouse themes.
